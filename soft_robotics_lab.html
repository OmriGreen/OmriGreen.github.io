											<h3>Overview</h3>
											<p>Some animals such as sea snakes being capable of locomotion in multiple environments.  To emulate the abilities of these animals there are a wide variety of potential approaches, from using nitinal wire to arrays of servos, however, without essentially building an actual snake from scratch we will be unable to replicate its performance without leveraging mechanisms that nature cannot use.  </p>

											<h3>Approach</h3>
											<p>To successfully emulate the performance of these animals using current technology, we have to leverage a mechanism out of antiquity, the archimedes screw.  The reasoning behind this is quite simple, when these screws are hollow, they can flex and move, this is a common technique used in auger conveyors to move grain.  Since, archimedes screws are already to move all terrain vehicles everywhere from the artic to swamps, the question is can we make a driven helix flexible?</p>

										<h3>Current Progress</h3>
										<p>Based on the initial version of the sinusoidal drive, this is very much the case, it can drive the robot forward on grass, while exhibiting the desirable flexibility as seen in  a variety of tests.  However, that isn't to say that there aren't issues, the main problem with using an entirely flexible helix is that the robot can "droop" dragging itself along the ground and not havaing enough power to push itself forward on solid ground.</p>

                                        <h3>Next Steps and Potential Future Research</h3>
                                        <p>To fix this I need to give the robot a "skeleton" with rigid helices forming the bones holding the heavier parts up to ensure that the robot will never "droop", these rigid sections will be connected by flexible helices enabling the same desired flexibility without any of the drawbacks similar to the biology of actual snakes.  If these helices can be used to drive an exterior skin on the robot, carrying the movement with them while maintaining flexibility it can open up a wide variety of possibilities from robots that can go on land as easily as underwater, to more odd configurations such as flexible thrusters.
