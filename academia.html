							<h1>NeRF Augmented Reality, Machine Learning Final Project</h1>
						</header>
						<div class="image main"><img src="images/AR.jpg" alt="Augmented Reality" /></div>
						<p>I am currently working on a team to modify the Instant NeRF algorithm in order to scan environments and allow for the easy replacement, 
						placement, and /or removal of objects from a scan of the environment. 
						<br>This can allow for easy use of augmented and virtual reality for applications ranging from enabling the integration of real world elements into a virtual world to allowing for virtual rearrangement of furniture.

						<h1>Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation, Robot Controls Final Project</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/auv.jpg" alt="An image of a AUV scanning an environment" /></div>
					<p>I am currently working on a team to implement control algorithm for a Autonomous Underwater Vehicle.<br>
					This algorithm will allow for point to point navigation in a virtual environment even with unexpected conditions.<br>
					To achieve this we are using a pre-existing dynamic representation of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle.

						<h1>Dynamics of Biomimetic Robotic Self-Assemblages, Robot Dynamics Final Project</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/biomemetic.jpg" alt="3 Robots in a Triangular Formation" /></div>
					<p>This project details the development of a modular robot for testing the dynamics of robotic self-assemblages<br>
						To achieve this we created a custom dynamic model of the robot for each individual robots<br>
						To test the dynamic model we created a Gazebo Simulation. <br>
						However, while we were successful in creating the dynamic model, we could not test the self-assemblages.

					<div class="image main"><img src="images/grasp.jpg" alt="3 Robots in a Triangular Formation" /></div>
					<p>This project details the development of an Ensemble network using the GR-CNND, GG-CNN-RGB, and GR-CNN grasping experts.<br>
						The network was trained on the Cornell image dataset.<br>
						The accuracy of the experts was raised from 70% to 85% by utilizing this ensemble.

						<h1>Maze Mapping and Navigation<br>
							RBE 3002 Final Project</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/RBE 3002.png" alt="A Robot localizing in a maze" /></div>
					<p> This project details the development of a ROS program with a team that used SLAM, AMCL, and A star to enable a Turtlebot 3 Burger to autonomously navigate, map, and localize itself inside a maze. <br>
						C-space, frontier detection, navigation, and frontier detection algorithms were made from scratch. <br>
						The nodes were programmed in Python, and the launch files were custom made.

							RBE 3001 Final Project</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/RBE 3001.png" alt="A Robot localizing in a maze" /></div>
					<p> This project details the creation of a computer vision controlled robotic arm system.<br>
						An event driven state machine was coded using MATLAB on a Linux workstation. <br>
						Test trials resulted in the robot being able to detect and localize balls before sorting them by color. <br>
						The system was then able to perform dynamic object tracking and unique object manipulation.

						<h1>Thus with a kiss I die<br>
							RBE 2002 Final Project</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/RBE 2002.jpg" alt="3 robots in a half circle" /></div>
					<p> I worked with a team to create a final system implemented on three robots that covered: Romi, Tybalt/Juliet, and
						Mercutio/Friar Lawrence (two robots played two characters).<br> The team’s system heavily utilized
						the MQTT protocol for WiFi communication between the robots to coordinate cues and timing
						for the scenes in Romeo and Juliet. <br>Using WiFi helped replace other communication methods like
						using an IR emitter and receiver, which had multiple disadvantages, namely range and visibility. <br>
						The team was also able to utilize the AprilTag tracking with theOpenMV camera, which
						allowed for the robots to consistently follow each other. <br>The code of the system was organized in
						a way so each character had a “script” for the scene with the necessary tasks needed to complete.
						<br>All robots also shared a common program that covered general functions for all due to having the
						same drive base.

						<h1>Robotic Replacement of Solar Collector Panels<br>
							RBE 2001 Final Project</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/RBE 2001.jpg" alt="3 robots in a half circle" /></div>
					<p> 
						On a team I helped develop a robot mounted 4-bar mechanism to place panels on tilted surfaces at differing heights and locations by utilizing the Solidworks design suite.<br>
						Additionally we designed 2 different grippers and mounted them on 2 robots to complete the pick and place tasks.<br>

					</header>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/RBE 1001.png" alt="3 robots in a half circle" /></div>
					<p> 
						On a team I helped program a prebuilt robot to retrieve and deploy cups to and from platforms of varying heights and locations using C++ and multiple sensors.<br>
						This was done completely autonomously, however, there was the option of remote control.
